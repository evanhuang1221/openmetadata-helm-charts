For OpenMetadata to successfully ingest data from a source database, the user account needs specific permissions. Here's a detailed breakdown of the required permissions:
Basic Connection Permissions:
CONNECT - Ability to connect to the database
USAGE - Basic usage rights on the database
Schema Level Permissions:
SELECT - To read data from tables
USAGE - On schemas to access metadata
DESCRIBE or SHOW - To view table structures
Metadata Permissions:
INFORMATION_SCHEMA access - To read system tables
SHOW TABLES - To list all tables
SHOW COLUMNS - To get column information
SHOW INDEXES - To get index information
SHOW CREATE TABLE - To get table creation statements
Specific Database Requirements:


For MySQL/MariaDB:


GRANT SELECT, SHOW VIEW ON database_name.* TO 'openmetadata_user'@'%';
GRANT PROCESS ON *.* TO 'openmetadata_user'@'%';


For PostgreSQL:
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO openmetadata_user;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO openmetadata_user;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA public TO openmetadata_user;


Additional Considerations:
The user should have read-only access
No write permissions are required
No admin privileges are needed
Should be able to query system tables/catalogs
Should have access to view table statistics
Security Best Practices:
Create a dedicated user for OpenMetadata
Use strong passwords
Limit access to only required databases/schemas
Regularly rotate credentials
Monitor user activity
Common Issues to Avoid:
Insufficient permissions on system tables
Missing schema-level permissions
Network access restrictions
IP whitelisting requirements
SSL/TLS requirements

Verification Steps
-- Test basic connection
SELECT 1;

-- Test schema access
SHOW TABLES;

-- Test table access
SELECT * FROM information_schema.tables LIMIT 1;

-- Test column access
SELECT * FROM information_schema.columns LIMIT 1;


Monitoring and Maintenance:
Regularly check user permissions
Monitor failed ingestion attempts
Review access logs
Update permissions as needed
Document permission changes
Troubleshooting:
Check connection logs
Verify network connectivity
Confirm credential validity
Review permission errors
Check database-specific requirements
Remember:
Different databases may have slightly different permission requirements
Some databases may need additional specific permissions
Always follow the principle of least privilege
Document all permission changes
Regularly audit user permissions
